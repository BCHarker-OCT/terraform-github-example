# Terraform Repository Structure Explain 

In a Terraform repository, each file and directory serves a specific purpose to organize and manage your infrastructure as code. Here's an overview of the mentioned components:

```bash
.
├── .gitignore
├── .terraform.lock.hcl
├── providers.tf
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── terraform.tfvars (may be in an environments/ directory)
├── backends/
├── environments/
├── .terraform.tfstate (or terraform.tfstate.d)
└── .terraform/
```

1. `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories for Git to ignore, preventing them from being tracked in version control. Common entries include:

    - Terraform state files (`*.tfstate`)
    - Backup files (`*.tfstate.backup`)
    - Local Terraform directories (`.terraform/`)
    - Plan output files (`*.tfplan`)
    - Sensitive variable files (`*.tfvars`)
1. `.terraform.lock.hcl`: Is created by terraform init and locks versions of our terraform providers and modules.  
1. `providers.tf`: Declares the providers your Terraform configuration requires, specifying details like authentication credentials and regions. For example:
```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-1"
}
```
1. `main.tf`: Contains the primary configuration for your infrastructure resources. This is where you define the actual resources to be created or managed, such as servers, databases, or networking components.
1. `variables.tf`: Defines input variables to parameterize your Terraform configuration, making it more flexible and reusable. Each variable can have a type, description, and default value. For example:
```terraform
variable "instance_count" {
  description = "Number of instances to create"
  type        = number
  default     = **1**
}
```
1. `terraform.tfvars`: Assigns values to the variables defined in `variables.tf`. This file is automatically loaded by Terraform to populate variable values.
For example:
```terraform
instance_count = 3
```
>[!NOTE]
In our example we have `z-dev-vars.tfvars` and `z-prod-vars.tfvars`, so it's more important to focus on the extension, rather than the naming convention.  

1. `backends/`: A directory that can be used to store backend configurations, which define where Terraform's state is stored. This is useful for organizing different backend settings, especially in complex environments.
1. `environments/`: A directory structure to separate configurations for different environments, such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`. Each environment can have its own set of Terraform files and variable definitions to manage resources specific to that environment.
1. `.terraform.tfstate` (or `terraform.tfstate.d/`): Files that store the state of your terraform project. These are very important files that record what has happened in your Terraform project. Often the files are kept in an S3 Bucket, to allow you to work with others at the same time on a project.
1. `.terraform/`: A directory created by Terraform to store modules and provider plugins. This is a local cache used during plan and apply operations and should not be version-controlled.

Although there is variation to these patterns this structure will help you create a well-organized project.
