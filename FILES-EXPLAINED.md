# Terraform Repository Structure Explain 

In a Terraform repository, each file and directory serves a specific purpose to organize and manage your infrastructure as code. Here's an overview of the mentioned components:

```bash
.
├── .gitignore
├── providers.tf
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── terraform.tfvars
├── backends/
├── environments/
└── .terraform/
```

1. `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories for Git to ignore, preventing them from being tracked in version control. Common entries include:

    - Terraform state files (`*.tfstate`)
    - Backup files (`*.tfstate.backup`)
    - Local Terraform directories (`.terraform/`)
    - Plan output files (`*.tfplan`)
    - Sensitive variable files (`*.tfvars`)
2. `providers.tf`: Declares the providers your Terraform configuration requires, specifying details like authentication credentials and regions. For example:
```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-1"
}
```
3. `main.tf`: Contains the primary configuration for your infrastructure resources. This is where you define the actual resources to be created or managed, such as servers, databases, or networking components.
4. `variables.tf`: Defines input variables to parameterize your Terraform configuration, making it more flexible and reusable. Each variable can have a type, description, and default value. For example:
```terraform
variable "instance_count" {
  description = "Number of instances to create"
  type        = number
  default     = **1**
}
```
5. `terraform.tfvars`: Assigns values to the variables defined in `variables.tf`. This file is automatically loaded by Terraform to populate variable values.
For example:
```terraform
instance_count = 3
```
>[!NOTE]
In our example we have `z-dev-vars.tfvars` and `z-prod-vars.tfvars`, so it's more important to focus on the extension, rather than the naming convention.  

6. `backends/`: A directory that can be used to store backend configurations, which define where Terraform's state is stored. This is useful for organizing different backend settings, especially in complex environments.
7. `environments/`: A directory structure to separate configurations for different environments, such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`. Each environment can have its own set of Terraform files and variable definitions to manage resources specific to that environment.
8. `.terraform/`: A directory created by Terraform to store modules and provider plugins. This is a local cache used during plan and apply operations and should not be version-controlled.

Although there is variation to these patterns this structure will help you create a well-organized project.
